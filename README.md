## Description
The AI-Driven Cancer Treatment Decision Simulator is a Python simulation that uses Tic-Tac-Toe mechanics to model the challenge of treating cancer. In this analogy, the playerâ€™s moves represent treatment options, and the AI opponent symbolizes cancer's adaptive challenges. Users must employ strategic thinking to win against the AI, making it an engaging way to practice decision-making skills.

## Features
- Intelligent AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm
- Player choice to move first or second
- Clear text-based interface for easy use

## Usage
To play the Cancer Treatment Decision Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Run the script.
2. Decide if you want to make the first move.
3. Enter your move (1-9) corresponding to board positions.
4. Watch as the AI responds with its optimal moves.
5. Continue until either the player wins, the AI wins, or a tie occurs.
